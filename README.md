# All Stocks-Analysis

## All Stocks-Analysis Summary:
For this challenge we were asked to refractured a macro for our friend Steve. Steve wants to help his parents with interpreting the performance of 12 identified stocks using 2 years of data. He wants to provide them with as much information as possible, so they can decide on where best to invest their money.

### All Stocks-Analysis Comparison: Refractured 2017 vs. Refractured 2018
The All Stocks-Analysis Refractured runtime for 2017 was 0.0703125s with 2018 registering in at 0.3945313s. Although the same macro, processing of 2017 stock data took less time, completing the process 0.3242185s sooner. 

### All Stocks-Analysis Comparison: Module 2017 vs. Refractured 2017
The All Stocks-Analysis Refractured macro runtime for 2017 was 0.0703125s. While the runtime for All-Stocks Analysis refractured for 2017 was 0.4023438s. The 2017 refractured runtime was the fastest of all the runtimes I observed.

### All Stocks-Analysis Comparison: Module 2018 vs. Refractured 2018
The All Stocks-Analysis module 2018 runtime was 0.41201563s. While the runtime for All-Stocks Analysis refractured for 2018 was 0.3945313s. These times are much closer than those of the 2017 to 2018 standard vs. refractured times. 

## Refractoring: Advantages vs. Disadvantages

### Advantages:
1)	Faster-more efficient runtime 
2)	Discovery of bugs or errors
3)	Improvement of overall design

### Disadvantages:
1)	Return on investment (time spent vs. results)
2)	Tinkering with something that already does the job. (If it works, why risk breaking it?) 
3)	Failing to improve upon code you already have 

## Reflection:
The advantages and disadvantages of refracturing code do vary. In this instance, improving upon a macro that works as fast and efficient as the module code did would not be feasible. In we were to expand data being analyzed to include multiple years of data on hundreds of stocks, then I believe improving upon what is in place. Currently the module code is sufficient in meeting Steveâ€™s needs.
